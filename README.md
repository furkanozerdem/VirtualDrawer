In this mode, camera follows your end of index finger position in every frame. Then, draws a line between coordinate of your current index finger position and previouse one.
As you keep your hand in this position, keeps drawing without interruption.


### 2- Cancel mode

In this position of hand, drawing mode stops. If you want to start drawing from another point of frame, raise up your middle finger and stop drawing.
And then you can move your hand the point you want to start drawing again.



### 3- Chose mode

This mode is to open up color palette you can use on the top of frame. Move your hand (follows end of your index finger) the color you want to draw. And that's it! You are clear to draw. 


### 4- Cleaning mode

By using this mode, you can clean up your drawings. Camera still follows your end of finger position but delete mode thickness is much more big than drawing mode.
So you can easily remove your drawings.

Tip: If you want to clean up faster, you can move your hand to camera a little bit. By this way, you increase your cleaning area on the camera frame.
